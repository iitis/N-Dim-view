# N-Dim-view plugin for dpVision

**N-Dim-view** is a plugin for the open-source platform [dpVision](https://github.com/pojdulos/dpVision) that provides an interactive 3D visualisation of multidimensional data using expressive avatars. The plugin combines spatial projection with glyph-based visual metaphors to help users explore complex datasets in an intuitive and visually engaging way.

The current [version 0.1.0](https://github.com/iitis/N-Dim-view/releases/tag/v0.1.0) refers to the content of the article: **Visualisation of a multidimensional point cloud as a 3D swarm of avatars**, [preprinted on arXiv](http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.06751).

## üß† Key Features

- **Chernoff-inspired avatars** ‚Äì Each data point is visualised as a small figure ("avatar") whose facial traits represent selected data dimensions.
- **3D spatial projection** ‚Äì Additional dimensions are mapped to position in a 3D coordinate system, allowing for interactive navigation and inspection.
- **Custom slab slicing** ‚Äì Users can control the thickness of the visible data layer in nD space, focusing on cross-sections of interest.
- **Manual assignment** ‚Äì Flexible mapping of data dimensions to avatar appearance or spatial coordinates.
- **Support for real and synthetic data** ‚Äì Tested with a 15D wine quality dataset and an artificial 4D tesseract-shaped dataset.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Author and Contributors

The main author of this plugin is **[Leszek Luchowski](mailto:lluchowski@iitis.pl)**, responsible for the concept, model design, and algorithmic implementation.

**[Dariusz Pojda](https://github.com/pojdulos)** contributed to the project by integrating the plugin with the `dpVision` platform and optimising its performance.


## üì¶ Installation

The plugin is designed to work with `dpVision` version X.X or higher.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iitis/n-dim-view.git
    ```

2. Copy the plugin folder to the `dpVision/plugins/` directory.

3. Reconfigure your dpVision project with CMake or &mdash; if you do not use CMake &mdash; simply add a plugin project (n-dim-view.vcxproj) to dpVision solution in MS Visual Studio

4. Build your dpVision project 

5. Launch `dpVision` and find the plugin in the plugin manager.

6. Use the plugin with your dataset.

<!-- 

## üìä Input Format

The plugin expects a dataset in the form of a matrix:
- Rows: dimensions (features)
- Columns: data points

A separate configuration file (optional) can be used to:
- assign dimensions to facial traits (e.g., eye shape, mouth curvature)
- assign dimensions to spatial coordinates (e.g., X, Y, Z)
- define viewing parameters, PCA settings, or label colours

-->

## üöÄ Example Use Cases

- Visualising clusters in high-dimensional data
- Exploring correlations between human-perceived qualities and technical parameters
- Educational visualisation of abstract geometries (e.g., 4D rotation)
- Dimensionality reduction with interpretability

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap

Planned features include:
- Support for alternative glyph styles (trees, neutral geometric forms)
- Heuristic or ML-based automatic dimension-to-feature mapping
- Scalability enhancements for large datasets
- Export to interactive WebGL viewers
- User feedback and usability testing
